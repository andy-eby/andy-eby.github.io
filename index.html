            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: -10px;">I'm a junior at Indiana University, majoring in computer science with a focus on artificial 
            intelligence and a minor in informatics. I have strong programming skills in Python, and C, and I 
            enjoy applying these skills in creative ways. My passion for innovative problem-solving drives me
            toward a career in machine learning, where I can combine technical expertise and creativity to make 
            a real-world impact.</p>
