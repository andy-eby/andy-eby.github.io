                <ul>
                    <li>Developed a single-player 3D boxing game in Unity using a physics-driven animation system with root motion for realistic player movement and attacks.</li>
                    <li>Designed enemy AI with dynamic combat behavior including pathfinding, ranged engagement, and procedural retreating for a realistic opponent.</li>
                    <li>Utilized Unity Animator controllers with blend trees and triggers to coordinate complex attack combos, dodges, and movement animations.</li>
                    <li>Incorporated custom AI generated assets from Meshy, Udio, and ElevenLabs, along with assets from the Unity store.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Developed an NFL Trade Outcome Prediction Model to assess how player performance changes after a trade (Offensive players only).</li>
                    <li>Processed a Kaggle dataset (2012-2023) by removing outliers, selecting key features, and applying min-max normalization.</li>
                    <li>Developed Player Performance Score (PPS) and Team Position Score (TPS) to quantify player and team trade value.</li>
                    <li>Trained a Linear Regression model to predict player performance post-trade based on historical data.</li>
                    <li>Created heatmap visualizations to identify team strengths and weaknesses for better trade decisions.</li>
                    <li>Evaluated model accuracy using RÂ², RMSE, and MAE to ensure reliable trade predictions.</li>
