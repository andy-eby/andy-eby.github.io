                <ul>
                    <li>Developed an NFL Trade Outcome Prediction Model to assess how player performance changes after a trade (Offensive players only).</li>
                    <li>Processed a Kaggle dataset (2012-2023) by removing outliers, selecting key features, and applying min-max normalization.</li>
                    <li>Developed Player Performance Score (PPS) and Team Position Score (TPS) to quantify player and team trade value.</li>
                    <li>Trained a Linear Regression model to predict player performance post-trade based on historical data.</li>
                    <li>Created heatmap visualizations to identify team strengths and weaknesses for better trade decisions.</li>
                    <li>Evaluated model accuracy using RÂ², RMSE, and MAE to ensure reliable trade predictions.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Developed a fashion recommendation system using machine learning models to suggest personalized clothing based on user entered attributes</li>
                    <li>Trained K-Nearest-Neighbors, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models on a Kaggle dataset containing 45,000 clothing items with attributes.</li>
                    <li>Users provide preferences (gender, clothing type, color, season, usage context) to receive personalized recommendations.</li>
                    <li>Cosine similarity between user preferences and predicted items is used to measure recommendation quality.</li>
